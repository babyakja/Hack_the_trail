In the heart of Austin is the Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail at Lady Bird Lake, a 10-mile path that attracts more than 4.4 million visits a year for outdoor recreation. TTF is a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting and enhancing the Trail and ensuring it remains one of Austinâ€™s premier places to visit. Outdoor Voices is an activewear brand on a mission to get the world moving and building happy, healthy lives. This enviro hack is an opportunity for Walmart Technology, TTF, Outdoor Voices, and the Austin community to come together to innovate and benefit the Trail. Throughout the weekend, attendees will form teams and participate in a series of challenges. Mentors will be onsite to help guide everyone through the process.
